# -IOT-AB-OOPS-PROGRAMS-IN-PYTHON
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm that structures code around the concept of "objects." These objects are instances of "classes," which serve as blueprints for creating them. OOP aims to model real-world entities and their interactions within a program, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
